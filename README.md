# Coding Boot Camp Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This Study Guide webpage was built to create a study guide to review the concepts covered during prework. As a boot camp student, I built this project to explore the stages of the web development and gain hands-on experience in building a webpage. A common real-world problem new boot camp students face is keeping track of the amount of information they are continously learning each day. This webpage serves as a convenient and personalized resource to store and display all of that information in one place.
