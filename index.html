          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements which provide the content and basic framework</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening and closing tag "<>," which contain everything we wish to include in the element " </li>

          <li>Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of each version of a project</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Every time a version of our work is saved using version control, a unique identifier called an SHA, or hash, allows you to keep a record of the specific changes committed</li>
            </ul>
          <li>We access Git using the command line</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Unlike bash commands, Git commands always start with “git” and are used to save and track versions of our code</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Git commands can be used to initiate (create) a repository, add code to the repository, and view different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can find a list of the most important and commonly used Git commands here: <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs" target="_blank">Git Command Cheat Sheet </a> </li>
            </ul>
          <li>While git can track changes locally on our computer, collaborating with others requires a tool called GitHub</li>
            <ul>
              <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Developers use repositories to store the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Files that contain code</li>
              <li>Files that contain other information about the code, like a README file</li>
              <li>The version history for all of the files in the repository</li>
            </ul>
          <li>When making changes locally, it is important to keep the local branch in sync with the remote repository/li>
          <li>To keep the two in sync, we use the GitHub workflow</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions</li>
          <li>Every GitHub repository starts with a default branch called main</li>
            <ul>
              <li>From the main branch, we can create new branches called feature branches where changes can be made without disrupting the main branch</li>
              <li>In a feature branch, all changes made should include a commit message that is descriptive of what changed in the code</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Changes made via feature branches are only integrated after merging into the main branch</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A pull request, or PR, is used to merge into the main branch</li>
            </ul>
          <li>You can read more about the different stages of GitHub flow and branching here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow" target="_blank">GitHub Docs on GitHub flow </a>  </li>
